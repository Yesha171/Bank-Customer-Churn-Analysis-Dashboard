# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard

Problem Statement:
The banking industry faces a significant challenge in retaining customers. Customer attrition, also known as churn, can result in substantial revenue loss and decreased profitability. Understanding the factors contributing to churn and identifying at-risk customers are critical for proactive intervention and effective retention strategies.

Overview:
This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of bank customer data using interactive dashboards. The analysis is structured into two main sections:
1.	Customer Analysis: This section offers a broad overview of the customer base, segmenting them by various demographic and behavioral attributes. Key visualizations include:
o	Customer Distribution by Gender: A pie chart showing the ratio of male to female customers.
o	Customer Distribution by Activity Status: A pie chart showing the proportion of active and inactive customers.
o	Customer Distribution by Credit Card Status: A pie chart showing the percentage of customers who own credit cards.
o	Customer Distribution by Country: A pie chart illustrating the geographical distribution of customers.
o	Customer Distribution by Products: A bar chart showing the number of customers using each product.
These visualizations provide valuable insights into customer segmentation and reveal underlying trends within the customer base.
2.	Churn Analysis: This section focuses on identifying factors influencing customer churn and providing an overview of the churn rate. Key visualizations include:
o	Overall Churn Rate: A gauge chart indicating the overall percentage of customers who have churned.
o	Churn Rate by Credit Score: A line chart showing the churn rate across various credit score ranges alongside the total number of customers in each range.
o	Churn Rate by Age Group: A line chart showing the churn rate across different age groups alongside the total number of customers in each group.
o	Churn Rate by Account Balance: A line chart showing the churn rate across different account balance ranges alongside the total number of customers in each range.
These visualizations highlight the relationship between churn rate and key customer attributes, enabling targeted churn reduction efforts.
The dashboards also include interactive filters for "Churn Status" and "Gender," allowing users to further explore the data and uncover hidden patterns.

Conclusion:
The dashboards generated from this analysis provide a valuable tool for banks to gain a deeper understanding of their customer base and the factors influencing churn. By utilizing these insights, banks can implement more effective strategies for customer retention.

Key areas for action include:
•	Identifying and targeting at-risk customers based on attributes like credit score, age group, and account balance.
•	Improving customer experience to decrease churn rates.
•	Tailoring product offerings to the specific needs of different customer segments.

The code and analysis in this repository serve as a starting point for further explorations and enhancements in customer churn analysis, allowing data-driven decisions to be made that will ultimately improve customer retention and business outcomes.
